Bugfixes, improvements and new features are much appreciated. For big(ger), new features, do reach out by creating an issue on the GitHub repo first.

This project uses [Standard](https://github.com/testdouble/standard) for formatting Ruby code. Please run `be standardrb` before submitting pull requests. Run tests with `rails test`.

Get set up by running `bin/setup`.

`rake` runs both `rails test` and `bundle exec standardrb`. `bin/ci` runs various steps to ensure code quality, security and test coverage before deployment.
