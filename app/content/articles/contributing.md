Bugfixes, improvements and new features are much appreciated. For bigger new features, do reach out by [creating an issue in the GitHub repo first](https://github.com/rails-designer/perron/issues/new).

This project uses [Standard](https://github.com/testdouble/standard) for formatting Ruby code. Please run `bundle exec standardrb` before submitting pull requests. Run tests with `rails test`.

`rake` runs both `rails test` and `bundle exec standardrb`.

Get set up by running `bin/setup`.
