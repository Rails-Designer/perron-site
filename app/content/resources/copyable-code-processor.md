This snippet adds a processor to add a copy-button to your code blocks (pre-tags).

> [!note]
> As this processor is powered by [Attractive.js](https://github.com/rails-designer/attractive.js), make sure to follow its installation instructions.

It is unstyled so you need to bring your own CSS. For an example of one using Tailwind CSS, [refer to the processor used on this site](https://github.com/Rails-Designer/perron-site).
